Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Lanely — Minimalist Freight CRM & Shipment Management Platform
1. Product Overview
1.1 Product Name

Lanely

1.2 Product Vision

Lanely is a modern, minimalist, design-first CRM and operations platform purpose-built for trucking, freight brokerage, and logistics businesses. It combines shipment tracking, rep assignment, commission visibility, and pipeline management into a single, calm, beautiful interface.

Lanely takes heavy inspiration from Attio, Linear, and Superhuman — prioritizing:

clarity over clutter

whitespace over density

motion over static screens

delight over raw utility

Lanely is not a traditional TMS.
It is a people-centric, revenue-centric logistics CRM.

Soft shadows, never harsh

Muted color palette with 1–2 accent colors

Primary inspiration:

Attio

Linear

Arc Browser UI

Vercel Dashboard

Raycast
